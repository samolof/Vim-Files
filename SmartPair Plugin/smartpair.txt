 Vim global plugin for automatically closing braces,
 quotemarks, and other char pairs 
 Version: 0.1

 License:   This file is placed in the public domain.

To enable, create the .vim/plugin subdirectory in your 
home directory if it doesn't 
already exist and place this file in it.
If enabled, vim will automatically insert the closing 
half of a brace, quote mark or any other 
character (or multi-character) defined in the
cpCharPairs dictionary.
Use the <TAB> key to navigate to just outside the immediate close pair.
To avoid auto insertion tap the character twice. E.g tapping {{ 
inserts { without the closing }

Characters for which this works (also works for multi-character pairs) 
can be set by defining the cpCharPairs dictionary in your vimrc file. 
For example:

	let cpCharPairs={ '[' : ']'  ,     '(' : ')'   , '\*' : '*\' }

The plugin is enabled by default. To turn it off by default 
add this line to your vimrc file:

	let g:SmartPairsDefault=Off

You may also define a mapping for toggling it on/off by 
mapping a key or command to <Plug>SmartPairsToggle. 
For e.g in my vimrc I have mapped the <F5> key:

	nmap <F5>   <Plug>SmartPairsToggle

The default toggle command is \p in normal mode.



Commands:					*Smartp*
:Smartp {cmd} [{args} ] 
	{cmd} is either:
	'remove'	Remove one or more pairs from the set. 
			Each arg should be the 
			opening character(s) of the pair
			E.g :Smartp remove { [ ( 
	'show'		Show the current set of mapped char pairs
	'default'	Restore the default set 
	'add'		Add new pairs e.g add { } \* *\
